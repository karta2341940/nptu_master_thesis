# NPTU Computer Science and Information Engineering Thesis Proposal 

## Title : <br>A symmetric encryption algirithm <br> By using replacement and displacement block.

## Advisor : <br>Lung-Jen Wang,Ph.D
## Author : <br>Meng-Xian,Du

# Abstract
Information security is more and more important in nowadays. The Rijndael encryption algorithm is the most security symmetric encryption algorithm currently. 

This study expects to propose a novel encryption algorithm to make a new option for people.
